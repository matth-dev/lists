# Lists of lists

A very basic to-do/shopping lists app made using Python and FastApi

## 🔍 Project Overview

With this app you can create and archive lists, add/delete/validate items in created lists.

The main goals of this project were :
- Practice implementing a complete REST API with all CRUD operations
- Learn how HTML/JavaScript frontends communicate with Python backends via HTTP
- Understand the request-response cycle in web applications
- Build something functional while exploring full-stack development concepts
